We'll be creating a simple database using AWS RDS (Relational Database Service) and populate it with some basic data. Perfect for beginners!
Tools and Applications used 🛠️
•	AWS RDS: Where the magic happens, our database service.
•	MySQL: Database engine we'll use.
•	AWS Security Groups: To manage who can access our DB.
