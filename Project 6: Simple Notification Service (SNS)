Project 6: Simple Notification Service (SNS) 📬
Brief Overview 🌟 Unlock the power of real-time communication using AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) in this exciting beginner-level project. We'll set up a cloud-based messaging system that integrates with AWS Lambda, allowing you to send notifications straight to your inbox. A must-try for anyone looking to explore cloud-based messaging and event-driven architectures!
________________________________________
In this project, we'll use AWS SNS to send a simple notification. Great way to get started with cloud-based messaging.
Tools and Applications used 🛠️
•	AWS SNS: For sending notifications.
•	AWS Lambda: To trigger the SNS.
The Play-by-Play Guide 📚

Step 1: SNS Central 🌐
1.	Open AWS Console: Navigate to Services -> SNS.
2.	Create Topic: Make a new topic.

Step 2: Subscription 📝
1.	Create Subscription: Choose your protocol, like Email.
2.	Endpoint: Enter the email where you want to receive notifications.

Step 3: Lambda Trigger 🖥️
1.	Go Back to Lambda: Remember that Lambda function? Let's modify it.
2.	Add SNS Trigger: In the Lambda function, import AWS SDK and add SNS publish code.

--Javascript Code
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const sns = new AWS.SNS(); 

exports.handler = async (event) => { const params = {
Message: 'Hello from SNS!', 

TopicArn: 'your-sns-topic-arn' 

}; 

return sns.publish(params).promise(); 
}; 

Step 4: Test & Receive 🧪
1.	Invoke Lambda: Run your Lambda function.
2.	Check Email: You should receive a notification email.
And there you go!
