AWS-Simple-Chatbot 🤖
Overview: 🌟
Wanna have a chatbot buddy? You're in the right place! This project uses AWS Lex to make a bot that helps set up appointments and checks the weather. Imagine a tiny robot in your computer—it's that cool!

🛠 Tech Stuff We're Using:
AWS Lex: This is where the bot lives. Think of it as its house!
Node.js or Python: You choose which language you want for the backend code.
Step-by-Step Guide Tip: Set a 5-minute timer for each step. It’ll help you concentrate!

Step 1: Opening AWS Lex
-Open your AWS Console in a browser.
-Look for “Services” at the top and click it.
-In the search bar, type “Lex” and click it.
- Do this: Click 'Create' and choose 'Custom Bot'. Name your bot something fun. Save it.

Step 2: Making Your Bot Smart
-On your Lex bot page, look for a button that says '+ Add Intent' and click it.
-You’ll see a spot to name your intent. Call it something like "ScheduleAppointment."
-Do this: Add 'slots'. These are the questions your bot will ask. Make one for 'Date' and one for 'Time'.

Step 3: Teaching Your Bot to Speak
You’ll see a section called 'Sample Utterances'.
👉 Do this: Type things like, "I want to schedule an appointment for [Date] at [Time]." This teaches the bot how to understand you. Save everything!

Step 4: Test and Done!
Click a big button usually at the top or bottom that says 'Build'.
After it's done building, test your bot in the AWS Lex console.
👉 Optional: If you're feeling extra, deploy your bot to places like Slack or build it into a web app.
