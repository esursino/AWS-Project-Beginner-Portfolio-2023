Project 5: Setup Microsoft Server with Active Directory on AWS

Objective:The goal of this project is to empower you to deploy and configure a Microsoft Windows Server with Active Directory on AWS. By the end of this tutorial, you'll not only have hands-on experience with AWS EC2 but also with managing a Windows Server environment. You'll learn how to:

•	Launch a Windows instance in AWS.
•	Set up security measures for remote access.
•	Install and configure Active Directory Domain Services.
•	Manage user accounts and access within your organization for up to 20 users.
Whether you're a student like me or , an IT professional looking to expand your skillset, or someone interested in cloud computing and network management, this project is your stepping stone to mastering AWS and Active Directory.


Prerequisites for Project:
•	An AWS account
•	A Remote Desktop client to connect to your Windows Server
________________________________________
Detailed Steps:
1.	Login to AWS Console
--	Navigate to the AWS Management Console and log in. Make sure you're in the region where you want to deploy your resources.

2.	Go to EC2 Dashboard
--In the "Find Services" bar, type in "EC2" and click on it to enter the EC2 dashboard.

3.	Initiate Instance Launch
•	Click on the "Launch Instance" button to create a new virtual machine.

4.	Choose AMI
•	In the "Choose an Amazon Machine Image" section, filter by "Windows" and select a Microsoft Windows Server AMI.

5.	Select Instance Type
•	In the "Choose an Instance Type" section, select t2.large or any other instance type that meets your needs.

6.	Configure Instance
•	Click "Next: Configure Instance Details."
•	Leave most settings as their default but make note of your VPC and Subnet settings.

7.	Storage Configuration
•	Click "Next: Add Storage" and add any additional storage if needed. 30-50GB should be fine for this project.

8.	Configure Security Group
•	Go to "Next: Configure Security Group."
•	Create a new Security Group, and add a rule for RDP with port range 3389. Make sure the source is set to "My IP" to restrict access to your own IP address.

9.	Launch Instance
•	Review your settings and click "Launch" to create the instance.

10.	Create and Download Key Pair
•	You'll be prompted to create a new key pair. Name it, download it, and keep it in a secure location.

11.	Retrieve Windows Password
•	After the instance is running, select it in the EC2 dashboard, click on "Actions," and then "Get Windows Password." Use your downloaded key pair to decrypt the password.

12.	Connect via RDP
•	Use your Remote Desktop client to connect to the instance using the public IP address provided in the EC2 dashboard and the decrypted Windows password.

13.	Install Active Directory
•	Once logged in, open Server Manager.
•	Go to "Add roles and features" and select the "Active Directory Domain Services" role. Install it.

14.	Promote to Domain Controller
•	After installation is complete, go back to Server Manager.
•	Click on the warning icon, then click "Promote this server to a domain controller."
•	Follow the wizard to create a new forest and domain. Set a DSRM (Directory Services Restore Mode) password when prompted.

15.	Create User Accounts
•	After the server restarts and you're logged in as the domain administrator, go to "Server Manager."
•	Navigate to "Tools" > "Active Directory Users and Computers."
•	Right-click on the "Users" folder under your domain and choose "New" > "User."
•	Create 20 user accounts, setting usernames and strong passwords for each.

16.	Access Management
•	While still in "Active Directory Users and Computers," you can organize your users into Organizational Units (OUs) and apply group policies for access management.

17.	Testing
•	Use a different computer or virtual machine to join the domain and log in with one of the new user accounts to confirm everything is working as expected.

18.	Document on GitHub
•	Create a new README.md file in a GitHub repo dedicated to this project.
•	Thoroughly document each step, including screenshots if possible, so that others can replicate your setup without any hiccups.
